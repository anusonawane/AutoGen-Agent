      "\n",

      "3. **The Norwegian Fjords**: A visit to Norway wouldn't be complete without experiencing the breathtaking fjords. Some of the most famous ones include Geirangerfjord, N√¶r√∏yfjord, and Sognefjord. You can take a cruise, kayak, or hike to appreciate their beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Troms√∏**: If you're visiting in the winter, Troms√∏ is a great place to see the Northern Lights. In the summer, you can enjoy the midnight sun. Don't miss the Arctic Cathedral and the Polaria museum.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Lofoten Islands**: This archipelago in northern Norway is known for its dramatic scenery, with towering mountains, picturesque fishing villages, and pristine beaches. Hiking, fishing, and wildlife watching are popular activities here.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Oslo**: The capital city of Norway is a vibrant mix of modern architecture and rich history. Don't miss the Viking Ship Museum, the Opera House, and the Royal Palace.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Bergen**: Known as the gateway to the fjords, Bergen is a picturesque coastal city surrounded by mountains. Explore the colorful Bryggen district, ride the funicular up Mount Fl√∏yen for panoramic views, and visit the Fish Market.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **The Norwegian Fjords**: A visit to Norway wouldn't be complete without experiencing the breathtaking fjords. Some of the most famous ones include Geirangerfjord, N√¶r√∏yfjord, and Sognefjord. You can take a cruise, kayak, or hike to appreciate their beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Troms√∏**: If you're visiting in the winter, Troms√∏ is a great place to see the Northern Lights. In the summer, you can enjoy the midnight sun. Don't miss the Arctic Cathedral and the Polaria museum.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Lofoten Islands**: This archipelago in northern Norway is known for its dramatic scenery, with towering mountains, picturesque fishing villages, and pristine beaches. Hiking, fishing, and wildlife watching are popular activities here.\n",
      "\n",

One such gem is the Kerameikos Archaeological Site, located northwest of the Acropolis. This ancient cemetery dates back to the 12th century BC and offers a fascinating look into the burial customs and rituals of ancient Athens.\n",

This well-preserved temple is dedicated to the god of craftsmanship and metalworking, Hephaestus, and is one of the best-preserved temples in Greece. It's a less crowded site compared to the Parthenon, allowing for a more intimate experience.\n",
